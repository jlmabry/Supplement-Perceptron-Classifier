# Supplement Perceptron Classifier

## Overview
A machine learning–based perceptron classifier that categorizes dietary supplements based on ingredient profiles and health categories. Includes a PyQt GUI for user input and predictions.

## Features
- Perceptron-based machine learning model
- MySQL database for training/testing data
- PyQt GUI for real-time predictions
- Data preprocessing pipeline

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SciPy
- MySQL
- PyQt
- Machine Learning (Perceptron)

## How It Works
The perceptron model is trained on labeled supplement data stored in MySQL. The GUI allows users to input supplement attributes and receive a predicted category.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlmabry/Supplement-Perceptron-Classifier
cd Supplement-Perceptron-Classifier
